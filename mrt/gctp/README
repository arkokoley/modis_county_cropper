This directory contains the source code for the new C version
of the GCTP.

The files nad27sp and nad83sp are used for State Plane.  If there 
seems to be a problem with these, the files nad1927.dat and nad1983.dat 
can be converted from ASCII to the proper binary format by using SPLOAD.

The following is a list containing the files in the geolib/source directory.

The files
    lamazellipsfor.c
    lamazellipsinv.c
were added to handle the ellipsoidal LAEA case.  These are not implemented
in GCTP since they are not necessarily supported elsewhere and have not been
accepted by the USGS.  The inverse case may not be fully correct yet, as
running lat/long to x/y back to lat/long doesn't quite produce the correct
lat/long value.  However, the forward case is correct.  (Gail Schmidt, Jan. 06)
